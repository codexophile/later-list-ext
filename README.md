# LaterList Extension

This is a Chromium browser extension inspired by the Onetab extension. The goal is to create a functional and user-friendly extension that allows users to manage their tabs efficiently.

## Features

- Save and restore tabs
- Organize tabs into groups
- User-friendly interface
- Reorder tabs directly in the view via drag-and-drop
- Main view stays open in a single pinned tab to avoid duplicates

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Load the extension in Chrome via `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable Developer Mode and load the unpacked extension.

## Usage

- Click the extension icon to save your current tabs.
- Access saved tabs from the popup interface. The main LaterList view lives in a pinned tab; actions reuse that tab instead of opening new ones.
